* pdfout
Fast PDF analysis and manipulation tool. Based on the [[http://mupdf.com/][MuPDF library]] and the [[http://yaml.org/][YAML data serialization standard]].

This is *EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE:* interfaces and input/output formats are still evolving.
So do not (yet) rely on it for production use.

pdfout can
 - dump and modify outlines, page labels, keys of the information dictionary
 - extract text
 - regex search each page's text. Supports many of GNU Grep's options and prefixing of search results with the page label and/or index. 
 - repair broken cross-reference tables
